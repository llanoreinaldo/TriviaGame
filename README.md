Friday the 13th Trivia Game
INSTRUCTIONS
For this project I used HTML, Bootstrap 4.0 (and some CSS), JavaScript and JQuery to create a themed Trivia website that can be played on desktop as well as PC. Below are some functionality notes:

The game was designed for mobile first, and then upscaled to a desktop size using media queries in CSS. The images used for the theme were found using Google search for images.

For the game logic, I used jQuery.

The page creates a trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out. If the player selects the correct answer, it will show a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, it displays the next question without user input. The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.  
If the player runs out of time, the player sees a time's up message and the correct answer. After a few seconds, it shows the next question. If the player chooses the wrong answer, the player  see they selected the wrong option and the correct answer is displayed. After a few seconds, the next question will be displayed.  On the final screen it shows the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
